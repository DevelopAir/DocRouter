Hellv, World] in Scala
Here are two ways id deﬁne a pmmm wnicn outputs ~llelld, World!‘ in seala:
1 _ uh] ect Mellollor'ld extends ADD (
Z Pr'mtVlCHellm Worldk")
3 J
nr
1 ~ uh1ect lieilolnor-ld t
z ~ def paintings: Arrdy[5tr\ng]) t
3 princlnC'MeHu. Mann")
4 }
5 J

ln seala. the main or entry point methnd is deﬁned in an object. An opjeer ran he made executable pyeiiner adding

extending the type App nr by adding a methnd def main(args: ArmyEtrinﬂ].

Source Files, Classﬁles and the jVM

seala source cnde is stared in text ﬁles with the extension .scala. Typically Scala programmers create nne source ﬁle

for each class, or one source ﬁle for a class hierarcrw: In fact, Soala allnws multiple dasses and objects tn be

deﬁned in the same snurce ﬁle.

o The name ofa Soala source ﬁle can be chosen freely, but it is recommended tn usethe name nfa class which is
deﬁned in that file.

o Package nierarrnies shnuld be reﬂected in directory sirueﬁlre: a source ﬁle deﬁning class c in package fon.bar
should be stored in a subdirectory as fon/harICscala. Soala does nnt really enfnrre this convention, but some
tnols such as the seala IDE for eclipse might have pmblems otherwise.

The seala compiler compiles .scala source ﬁles tn .dass ﬁles, like the java compiler. Classﬁles are binary ﬁles

coniaining mamine eode for the Java Virtual Macnine. ln order to run a Scala program, the jVM nas tn krldw the

directnry wnere classﬁles are Stored. This parameter is called the “dasspath'.

lfyou are using eclipse or sbt to campile and run wur Scala cnde, wu don't need id do any of the above manually »

these tonls take eare pr immkirlg the Scala cnmpiler and the jVM with the correcl arguments.
